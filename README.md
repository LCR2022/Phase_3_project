## Data Usage Strategy:
SyriaTel, a prominent telecommunications provider, is confronted with escalating customer churn rates, impacting both revenue and market share.
To address this challenge, an in-depth analysis was conducted, leveraging a combination of customer usage data, service plans, and interaction history.
This data served as the foundation for exploring patterns and predictors of churn through statistical analysis and machine learning models.
### Procedure Overview:

  1. **Data Collection**: Comprehensive datasets encompassing customer usage patterns, demographics, and service interactions were gathered.

  2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Initial exploration of the data revealed trends, correlations, and potential churn indicators.

  3. **Clustering Analysis**: Utilizing clustering techniques, the customer base was segmented into distinct groups based on various factors such as usage patterns and demographics.

  4. **Predictive Modeling**: Advanced predictive models were developed to assess the impact of different service features on customer retention and to identify customers at risk of churning.

  5. **Model Validation and Refinement**: The predictive models underwent rigorous validation using appropriate evaluation metrics. Refinements were made to enhance accuracy and generalizability.

  6. **Evaluation of Retention Strategies**: Long-term effectiveness of implemented retention strategies was evaluated through continuous monitoring and analysis of churn rates over time.

  7. **Recommendations**: Based on the analytical findings, bespoke retention strategies were formulated and recommended to increase customer satisfaction, foster loyalty, and ultimately reduce churn rates.


## Methodology.
   **Churn** is our independent variable.

**Target variable insights** :
These are the main factors to be investigated in the study:

_**Numeric Features**_:

- Subscription Period
- Number of voice Mail messages
- Total day Minutes
- Total day Calls
- Total evening minutes
- Total evening calls
- Total Night minutes
- Total Night calls
- Total International calls
- Total International minutes

## Procedures used to analyse the dataset
1. **Outliers Detection:**

- Outliers are data points that significantly deviate from the rest of the dataset.
  
- Detecting outliers helps in identifying unusual or anomalous behavior within the dataset, which could potentially skew statistical analysis or machine learning models.

- For SyriaTel, outlier detection could reveal extreme values in customer behavior metrics (e.g., call duration, data usage) or financial metrics (e.g., monthly charges), providing insights into irregular customer activities or billing discrepancies.

2. **Multicollinearity Analysis:**

- Multicollinearity refers to the high correlation between predictor variables in a regression analysis.

- Identifying multicollinearity helps in understanding how independent variables relate to each other and how they collectively influence the dependent variable.

- In the context of SyriaTel, multicollinearity analysis could reveal correlations between customer attributes (e.g., age, income) or service features (e.g., international plan, voice mail plan), helping to refine predictive models and understand the drivers of customer churn more accurately.

3. **Univariate Analysis:**

- Univariate analysis involves examining the distribution and characteristics of a single variable.

- It helps in understanding the central tendency, variability, and shape of the data distribution.

- In the SyriaTel dataset, univariate analysis could be used to explore the distribution of key variables such as customer tenure, monthly charges, customer service calls, and churn status.

- This analysis provides insights into the distributional properties of individual variables, enabling a deeper understanding of customer behavior and churn patterns.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis conducted on SyriaTel's customer churn data, several conclusions and recommendations can be drawn to address the challenges faced by the telecommunications company:

1. **Churn Analysis:**

The analysis revealed that the churn rate for SyriaTel is approximately 14.5%, indicating a significant portion of customers leaving the service.
Factors such as having an international plan and the number of customer service calls show a moderate positive correlation with churn, suggesting that these factors may influence customer retention.

2. **Customer Behavior Insights:**

Customers with an international plan are more likely to churn compared to those without one, indicating a need to investigate the reasons behind this trend.
The number of customer service calls shows a weak positive correlation with churn, suggesting that higher engagement with customer service may not necessarily lead to improved retention.

3. **Geographical Patterns:**

The distribution of churned and non-churned customers across different states reveals potential geographical variations in churn rates, which could be further explored to understand regional customer behavior.

6. **Service Usage Analysis:**

Analysis of service usage patterns, such as total day minutes and total evening minutes, did not show significant correlations with churn. 
However, further exploration may be warranted to understand the impact of these factors on customer retention.
